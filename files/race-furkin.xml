			<p class="flavor">The chaotic magic of the Feywild has long-reaching and unpredictable effects on anything that wanders into its realm and remains there. Over generations, common animals that wandered into the realm of the Feywild who had little choice but to carve out a living for themselves began to slowly change, becoming smarter and more humanoid while retaining some of their bestial features.</p>
			<h4>HISTORY</h4>
			<p>There are many places where the barrier between realms fluctuates, and it is not uncommon for many to accidentally wander into an alternate plane without realizing it. The same is true of any animal. Over generations of survival and breeding in the naturally magical realm of the Feywild, groups of animals that had become lost or who were swept into the realm began to slowly change. They became smarter, gained the power of speech, and started to walk upright. Tenuously at first, and then fully bipedal. They formed societies, learned languages, built homes.</p> 
			<p class="indent">Until the First Sundering.</p>
			<p class="indent">A group of archmages attempted to tear open the veil that separated the Prime Material Plane from the Feywild in a bid to claim the natural magic of the realm for themselves. They miscalculated, however. The magic of the Feywild was not something they could control, even as a group, and it destroyed them. The rift between the planes was left open long enough for many fey creatures to escape into the Prime Material Plane, including the creatures that had become known as kin. The scar from the Sundering still remains but is hidden deep within a forest and guarded by a city of kin that surrounds it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The kin were not well-received by the more common races (humans, elves, dwarves, and the like). Many viewed them as monsters or new breeds of lycanthropes. The kin were hunted by the common races, either to try and wipe them out or take them as slaves and trophies.</p>
			<h4>SOCIETY</h4>
			<p>Kin often keep to their own. Most people are uncomfortable with them, unable to distinguish them from lycanthropes. Although much younger than other races of the Material Plane, they are as advanced culturally due to their accelerated evolution. They usually live in tribal villages appropriately located near where their more wild counterparts can be found. Wolfkin and snakekin, for example, prefer forests, while heronkin and otterkin prefer rivers and lakes. Those kin that live with the more common races are almost always slaves or live in city slums where they can hide more easily. Kin in positions of power or nobility are almost completely unheard of and are very rarely treated with the same respect their peers demand.</p>
			<p class="indent">The kin are divided into three major groups.</p>
			<p class="indent">Scalekin are the Kin who evolved from beasts covered in scales such as snakes, turtles, and crocodiles.</p>
			<h4>FURKIN NAMES</h4>
			<p>Kin often take tribal-sounding names once they come of age. Names are generally agender in nature. Those few kin who grew up in other societies, either in slums or as slaves, are given names more appropriate to their surrounding culture.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Example Names</span>: Redfang, First Light, Earthborn, River Flower, Night Sky, Greeneye, Yellowtail, Ravenclaw

			<h4>FURKIN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Humanoid creatures that evolved from animals exposed to the chaotic magic of the Feywild.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Furkin are evolved from creatures that either had to hunt to survive or survive being hunted. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Due to the evolutionary effect of Feywild magics, kin live longer than their animal counterparts, but not as long as humans. Kin reach adulthood at around 10 years and can live to be around 50 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Kin encompass every alignment, but due to their tight knit sense of community, most tend towards the gentle side of lawful.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Kin run a wide gamut of body types. Your size is either Small or Medium as determined by your subrace.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Kin run a wide gamut of body types. Your speed is determined by your subrace.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fey Resistance.</em></strong> Due to the magic of the Feywild infusing their being, all kin, no matter what kind, have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read and write Common and Sylvan.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Wolfkin, Foxkin, Bearkin, Otterkin, Hyenakin, Lionkin, Ratkin.</p>
